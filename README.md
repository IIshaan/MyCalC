# MyCalC
This is a Calculator application which consists of atleast 3 concepts as a criteria by Google for the successful submission of the app. 
Some of the concepts I used are -
1) Callback method - To call onCreate on the superclass.
2) String Templates - To take inputs (digits) and covert it to string.
3) Named Parameters - To specify names of arguements while calling the function to return the answer.
4) Extension Function - Used for ToString().

<b>Note:</b> When you'll use the assignments (such as +,-,/,*) in the calculator, they won't be visible so move ahead without worrying why is it not working.
