# MyCalC
This is a Calculator application which consists of atleast 3 concepts as a criteria by Google for the successful submission of the app. 
Some of the concepts I used are -
1) Fragment OnCreate()
2) String Templates
3) Named Parameters
4) Inheritance

<b>Note:</b> When you'll use the assignments (such as +,-,/,*) in the calculator, they won't be visible so move ahead without worrying why is it not working.
